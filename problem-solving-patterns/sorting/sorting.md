## Different types of Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort** (O(n²)): Simple swaps for adjacent elements. Good for tiny data; learn to spot inefficiency. See [this file](./bubble-sort.js)
2. Insertion Sort (O(n²)): Builds sorted array by inserting one-by-one. Stable; like organizing cards.
3. **Merge Sort** (O(n log n)): Divide-conquer-merge. Recursive; teaches divide-and-conquer.
4. **Quick Sort** (avg O(n log n)): Pivot-based partitioning. Fast in practice; JS's sort() is similar (Timsort hybrid).

All these sorting are good to learn the inner working of the sorting mechanism and it can improve our logical thinking.

We can also learn how by default javascript can help us in sorting

- JS has its own `.sort()` method for doing this
- Please check [the file ](./sort-method-in-js.md) for more detailed examples
